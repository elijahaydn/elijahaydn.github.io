### Merry Christmas!

This is your awesome new website. Right now you can get here by going to http://www.elijahaydn.github.io BUT as part of your present I will buy you a domain name so you can go to something like ElijahIsAwesome.com or Unicronceeks.com to get here.  

You can use this site to do all sorts of cool stuff like:  

- Writing blog posts about Minecraft, Marimba, Soccer, or anything else!
- Putting links up to [cats.](https://nyan.cat)
- Putting your drawings online to show everyone.
- Making [cool music](https://soundcloud.com/upload) and putting it here for everyone to listen to. 
- Sharing links to [funny](https://www.youtube.com/user/BYUTelevision) [videos.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)  

You can use [Prose.io](http://prose.io/#elijahaydn) to add posts to your site. New posts are written in something called [Markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/lesson/1/), which programmers use to make documents. I will show you how to use it to make new posts.  

I love you!
